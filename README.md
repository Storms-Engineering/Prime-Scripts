# Prime-Scripts
Scripts for prime research

This scripts will check if 3 x (prime_number) - 10 = another prime number or semiprime

If it does then it says skipped:(prime number that was multiplied)
If not then it does a factorization of the output of the equation, (found on stackoverflow) and spits out the factors of the 
number that it found.
